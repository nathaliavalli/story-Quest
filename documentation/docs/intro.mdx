# Introduction : Bridging Social Gaps Through AAC and Collaborative Play

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to any method of communication that replaces or supports verbal speech. 
Children who rely on AAC often experience social isolation and difficulty engaging in collaborative learning environments, 
leading to challenges in literacy development, peer interactions, and self-expression. To foster inclusion and engagement, we 
have developed StoryQuest, an interactive, story-based "Mad Libs" style game that promotes collaboration, literacy development, 
and turn-taking skills. The game leverages the cloze phrase technique, a proven method in speech 
therapy that helps children improve language skills, word recall, and structured communication. Through team-based gameplay, 
players take turns contributing words to a shared story, encouraging social interaction, cognitive development, and 
problem-solving. By integrating AAC tools, structured repetition, and adaptive difficulty levels, StoryQuest ensures that 
all players—regardless of communication ability—can participate meaningfully, keep learning, and most importantly, have fun!
